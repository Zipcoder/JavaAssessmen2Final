# Java Assessment 2 - Submission Branch
* You _may_ need to first perform
```bash
git remote add zipcoder https://github.com/Zipcoder/JavaAssessmen2Final
git fetch --all
```


* This is the branch you will submit your project into! 

* Follow these steps to submit. 
	* Merge part 1 into this branch
	* Merge part 2 into this branch
	* Merge part 3 into this branch
	* Merge part 4 into this branch
	* Merge part 5 into this branch
	* Merge part 6 into this branch
	* Merge part 7 into this branch

* Each time you merge you may have a conflict with `ProjectTestSuite` file since you may have modified that file to run the tests.
* If this is the case, you can resolve these conflicts by editting the file to look like this

	```java
	package com.zipcodewilmington.assessment2;
	
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.junit.runners.Suite;
	
	/**
	 * Created by leon on 3/1/18.
	 * The purpose of this class is to test all methods in this project
	 */
	@RunWith(Suite.class)
	
	@Suite.SuiteClasses({
	})
	public class ProjectTestSuite {
	}
	```

* Each time you get this merge conflict, simply copy and paste the contents above into the `ProjectTestSuite` file
* Once you have done that, push your submission branch to your repository
* From there, make a pull request from your `repository/submission` branch to `Zipcoder/submission`
* The travis build should start up and your tests will run. 

#### Note: 
* While part 2 was not required, it will still run.
* If you were able to get any of that part running, it will benefit you but any failed tests will not affect your overall grade.
* As a result you may see a red x even though you may still get a perfect score.
