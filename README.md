# Java Assessment 2 - Submission Branch

This is the branch you will submit your project into! 

Follow these steps to submit. 

* Merge part 1 into this branch
* Merge part 2 into this branch
* Merge part 3 into this branch
* Merge part 4 into this branch
* Merge part 5 into this branch
* Merge part 6 into this branch
* Merge part 7 into this branch

Once you have done that, push your submission branch to your repository

From there, make a pull request from your repository/submission branch to Zipcoder/submission

The travis build should start up and your tests will run. 

#### Note: 
While part 2 was not required, it will still run. If you were able to get any of that part running, it will benefit you but any failed tests will not affect your overall grade. as a result you may see a red x even though you may still get a perfect score.
